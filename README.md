# GameBit
GameBit is a custom project made for Hackclub. 
It is a portable Gaming Console (HAT) with a 2 inch LCD Screen, Audio Capabilities, 8 buttons for gameplay and 2 for on/off functionality, powered by a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W.
It is 130 X 44 mm in dimensions. 

I plan to put custom games in it :3
I made GameBit because I've always wanted to build a hardware project on my own and making a gaming console seemed cute. It was a very challenging project for a beginner, but I have learned a lot in the journey of making it. Game consoles are something that exist and I found a couple tutorials here and there but i still had to use a lot of my own brain to make it. But the experience I got from making this one will help me make a project I've been wanting to make since years and the tutorials for which do not exist.
